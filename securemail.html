            <h3>Regular Email and Privacy</h3>
            <p>When you send an email, its contents are open for anybody to read. Email is like sending a postcard: anyone who can access it can read it.</p>
            <p>To keep data sent via email private, you need to encrypt it. Only the intended recipient will be able to decrypt the message while anybody else sees only gibberish.</p>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Public key encryption is a special case of encryption. It operates using a combination of two keys:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>a private key and
                    </li>
                    <li>a public key,
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>which together form a pair of keys.</p>

                <p>The private key is kept secret on your computer since it is used for decryption. The public key, which is used for encryption, is given to anybody who wants to send encrypted mail to you.</p>
                <p><strong>For the most secure setup</strong> it's best to move (not copy) your private key to a USB flash drive for safe keeping.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>Sending Public-Key Encrypted Mail</h4>
                <p>The sender's encryption program uses your public key in combination with the sender's private key to encrypt the message.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <h4>Receiving Public-Key Encrypted Mail</h4>
                <p>When you receive the encrypted message, you need to decrypt it. Decryption of a message encrypted with a public key can only be done with the matching private key. This is why the two keys form a pair, and it is also why it is so important
                    to keep the private key safe and to make sure it never gets into the wrong hands (or in any hands other than yours).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>Why the Integrity of the Public Key is Essential</h4>

                <p>Another crucial point with public key encryption is the distribution of the public key.</p>
                <p>Public key encryption is only safe and secure if the sender of an encrypted message can be sure that the public key used for encryption belongs to the recipient. A third party could produce a public key with the recipient's name and give
                    it to the sender, who uses the key to send important information in encrypted form. The encrypted message is intercepted by the third party, and since it was produced using their public key they have no problem decrypting it with their
                    private key.</p>

                <h4>This is why it is mandatory that a public key is either given to you personally <del>or authorized by a certificate authority.</del> (The CA model is so hopelessly broken it can be considered useless for this purpose.)</h4>

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web of Trust</a></h3>
            <p>The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP version 2.0:</p>

            <p>"As time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers. Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers. And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their
                key a collection of certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures. This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence
                for all public keys."</p>
            <p>For more information on Web of Trust issues and how to build such a Web of Trust, see <a href="http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.cryptnet.net/fdp/crypto/keysigning_party/en/keysigning_party.html</a>
            </p>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>Signing the Keys of Trusted Contacts</h4>
                <p>When you exchange public keys with people you trust, that is, you are completely certain of who you're dealing with, you use your own key to "sign" the key of the other person. This helps to build the Web of Trust, and eliminates issues
                    with man in the middle or third party interception type scenarios.</p>

            <p>PGP was the original encryption package. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. PGP is now a private, for-profit company, a division of Symantec and is a subscription based product. The Open Source equivalent in use now is GPG (GnuPrivacyGuard),
                and software is available for most operating systems. Both are based on the OpenPGP standard and are pretty much cross-compatible.</p>

                <p>GnuPG is the GNU project's complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 . GnuPG allows to encrypt and sign your data and communication, features a versatile key management system as well as access modules
                    for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available. Version 2 of GnuPG
                    also provides support for S/MIME.</p>

                    use proven, open source cryptography, all servers are Swiss and therefore protected by the Swiss Data Protection Act and outside of the US and EU's jurisdiction. They own all of their servers which are located under 1000 meters of
                    granite rock in a heavily guarded bunker which can survive a nuclear attack. ProtonMail keeps no logs of IP addresses or personally identifiable information. They also support setting expiration dates on encrypted emails, so they will
                    be deleted from the recipients mailbox once they have expired. This is the real deal. For more in-depth information on ProtonMail's security and features, visit their website <a href="https://protonmail.com/security-details/" target="_blank"

            <p><a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mailvelope</a> is a plugin supporting webmail encryption in Firefox and Chrome. Mailvelope is completely open source and based on <a href="https://openpgpjs.org"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPGP.js</a>, an OpenPGP library for JavaScript. It currently comes preconfigured for webmail providers Gmail, GMX, Outlook, Posteo, WEB.DE, Yahoo, and can be adjusted to work with other webmail
                providers.</p>
            <p>Any plugin based webmail solution where you type your message and then click a button to encrypt before sending is useless from a security standpoint because the provider can see your message as you type it before it is encrypted, thus is
                completely insecure. Mailvelope solves this by opening an external editor where you compose your message before encrypting and then inserting the encrypted message into the webmail compose window. It also features key generation and management
                functions.</p>
            <p>Mailvelope is currently in Beta status and does not support encrypted attachments. It is <strong>mandatory</strong> that you read and understand the instructions for proper use of the plugin if you wish to actually be secure.</p>
