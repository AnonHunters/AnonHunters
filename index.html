            cool moving picture video thingyz directly below this to get an idea of what we do. If you're already familiar with Anonymous, these videos aren't really neccessary.</p>

        <p>Wait, wut, ok, anyways. This is the tutorial information for #OpNewblood. Our mission is helping people interested in Anonymous get started, ranging from computer users who are constantly searching for the 'any key', to users who build and design
            supercomputers (ie Watson). Anyways, currently we cover helping you get a setup that allows you to stay in regular contact with other Anonymous and to help you browse and use the internet without exposing your location or any other sensitive
            information.</p>

            <h3>Security and Anonymity</h3>
            <p>OK now comes the bad news. Nothing is 100% secure or safe from eavesdropping. As we have seen recently with revelations about the wholesale spying on the world by the NSA, the subject of security and maintaining your privacy is now much higher
                on the list than ever before. People who once thought nothing about sending their most intimate details to another are now rethinking that situation. The internet has always been open. A closed and monitored internet defeats the purpose
                for which it was intended: the free and easy sharing of information, thoughts, ideas and knowledge.<br /> The Heartbleed SSL bug was big news and quite shocking to the security community and internet users in general. OpenSSL, which contained
                the error, has been fixed. Most applications that use OpenSSL have also been fixed. Website operators have been working to patch their systems, too. As for AnonHunter, we use GnuTLS, a different encryption library which was not part of the
                Heartbleed bug. Our webchat has been updated to the correct version of SSL and our security certificates have been revoked and reissued.<br /> Much is now heard about VPNs, encrypted connections, web pages and emails. So what are these
                mysterious things? Let us find out, shall we?</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h4>
                <p>A virtual private network is a connection from your computer to another network. Some of you may be familiar with these type of connections as they are widely used by businesses to handle their internal communications needs and to allow
                    employees to access systems from remote locations. Setup properly, they can also be used by anyone to create a safer connection to the internet and have the added benefit of disguising your true location. Click the link below for a
                    short tutorial on the different types of VPN connections and encryption.</p>

                <h4>Encryption</h4>
                <p>Recent news of how extensive the NSA's efforts to compromise internet security might make privacy seem impossible, but there is still hope. Edward Snowden said it in an online Q&amp;A soon after he made his first document public: &quot;Encryption
                    works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on.&quot; We've put together a short primer to help get you started with more secure email (and files).</p>
